# PresidentsDatabase

Our database is designed efficiently, and organized, to include information referencing current and past President(s) Of the United States. Notable information that we plan to display in the database includes, but is not limited to, political affiliation, date of birth, date of death, time served in office, economic status, notable actions, height, weight, which party controlled the senate and house, and their Vice President. This topic was chosen to help visualize interesting aspects of previous United States Presidents, and to evaluate them side-by-side.
